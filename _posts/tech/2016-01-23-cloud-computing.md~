##What's cloud computing?
for normal users:

Tradition: store our data on  desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.
Now:store our data on line using Dropbox, GoogleDrive, Microsoft OneDrive.
for business:

Tradition:buy your own host server, employee people to set and mantian them.
Now:build you service on line using AWS, GoogleCloudPlatform, Windows Azure.

## cloud clients 
Devices rely on cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless without it.such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones and any Ethernet enabled device such as Home Automation Gadgets.

## Service models
* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software.
* Platform as a service (PaaS):the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
* Software as a service (SaaS):users gain access to application software and databases.

## cloud computing types
* Private cloud: Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally.
* Public cloud: A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. 
* Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.
